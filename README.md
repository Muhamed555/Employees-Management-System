# About The Project 
This is the second project as an application of what I learned in object-oriented programming in the second semester of my university studies. Its idea includes a structure that is concerned with organizing employee data and includes the following characteristics:
1. Add and print projects
2. Adding a budget for an existed or new project
3. Add, edit, search and print employees
